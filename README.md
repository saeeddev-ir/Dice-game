# Project 2: JavaScript/Dice-Dame

## this game is one of my best projects with JavaScript.
### there are some tips that you need to familar with them

### Rules:
1. if you get 100 scores, you are the winner. congratulations:))))
2. if you click on 'Role Dice' button, you can get a random dice number
3. if you click on 'Hold' button, you can hold and save your score on a local host
4. you need to roll the dice again and again to get 100 scores.
5. only there is one exceptional rule; if you roll the dice and get number 1, you can't keep going. so, it's your competitor's turn.

I hope you like it ❤
 
best of luck 😎
